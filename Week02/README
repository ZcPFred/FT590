Important:

The written explaination for Problem 1 is in a separate pdf file called "Weekl 02 Project_ problem1.pdf".
All other answers(written and coding) are in the jupyter notebook called "FT590 Weekly02 Project.ipynb"
I also include a pdf version of everything from this jupyter notebook called "Week02 Project.pdf". In case you are more comfortable viewing pdf.
